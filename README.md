# Web Scraping and Text Classification Project

## Overview

This project is a web scraping and text classification tool that analyzes the content of a given website and automatically classifies it into predefined categories using machine learning techniques. The goal is to provide a convenient way to categorize websites based on their textual content.

## Features

- **Web Scraping:** Utilizes web scraping techniques to extract text content from a provided website.
- **Text Classification:** Applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to classify the content into predefined categories.
- **Kaggle Dataset Integration:** The project integrates a Kaggle dataset (available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sunilthite/text-document-classification-dataset)) for training and inference purposes.
- **Flask Web Application:** Implements a Flask web application to allow users to input a website URL and receive the predicted category.
